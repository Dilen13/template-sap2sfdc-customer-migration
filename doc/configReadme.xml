This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for setting an offline migration of Customers from SAP to Salesforce Accounts.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

The integration is triggered by an HTTP Endpoint that receives the migration request. Then it retrieves all customers from SAP using the standard BAPI **BAPI_CUSTOMER_GETLIST**, transforms them into Salesforce Accounts and passes them to the Batch process.

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverages the Batch Module. The batch job is divided in Input, Process and On Complete stages.

During the Process stage, in the first Step the Template will go to Salesforce and query all the existing Accounts matching the Name for each SAP Customer. In the following step, the Account will be upserted to Salesforce.

Finally during the On Complete stage the Template will both output statistics data into the console and send a notification email with the results of the batch execution.

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered.
All of them deal with the preparations in both source (SAP) and destination (SFDC) systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly.
**Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

Before continue with the use of this Anypoint Template, you may want to check out this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/SAP+Connector#SAPConnector-EnablingYourStudioProjectforSAP), that will teach you how to work 
with SAP and Anypoint Studio-

## Disclaimer

		<section id="api_calls">
		<![CDATA[
SalesForce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made.
Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to
consider. Customer migration template calls to the API can be
calculated using the formula:

**X / 200**

Being X the number of Accounts to be synchronized on each run.

The division by 200 is because, by default, Accounts are gathered in groups
of 200 for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. 
For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 1 api
calls to SFDC will be made ( 1).
